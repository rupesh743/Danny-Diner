# **Introduction**
Danny's Diner, a quaint restaurant specializing in sushi, curry, and ramen, is owned by Danny, a Japanese food enthusiast. Since its inception in early 2021, Danny has been collecting basic customer data but lacks the analytical expertise to leverage it for business insights. This case study aims to analyze customer behaviors, spending patterns, and menu preferences to help Danny enhance customer experience and make informed decisions about expanding the customer loyalty program.

# **Datasets**
The case study utilizes three key datasets:

**sales**

Contains transaction records of customer purchases.

customer_id: ID of the customer

order_date: Date of the order

product_id: ID of the purchased product

**menu**

Details about the menu items.

product_id: ID of the product

product_name: Name of the product

price: Price of the product

**members**

Information about the loyalty program members.

customer_id: ID of the customer

join_date: Date when the customer joined the loyalty program

# **Conclusions**

After conducting the analysis, I've uncovered several noteworthy findings that could be valuable for Danny:

Customer B holds the record for the most visits, with six visits in January 2021.

The most popular item at Danny's Diner is ramen.

Customer A and C are fans of ramen, while Customer B seems to enjoy sushi, curry, and ramen equally.

Customer A was the first member to join Danny's Diner, with their initial order being curry.

Prior to becoming members, Customer A spent $25 and Customer B spent $40.

In January 2021, Customer A accumulated 860 points, Customer B had 940 points, and Customer C had 360 points.

Assuming members can earn double points weekly from their registration date—excluding just sushi—Customer A has amassed 1370 points, and Customer B has 820 points by the end of January 2021.
